I am a software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and creativity. I started coding at the age of 13, creating Java plugins for Minecraft that garnered over 100,000 downloads. While studying accounting and finance at university, I continued to hone my coding skills as a hobby. My dissertation on behavioral economics sparked an interest in user experience and design, which has since become a key focus in my work.

After training to become an accountant, I made the switch to the IT department of a firm and began working as a full-time developer. After being a full-stack developer for a few years, I now work as a Developer Advocate at BetterStack, where I create content and guides to help developers learn and grow in their careers.
